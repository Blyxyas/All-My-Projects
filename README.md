Hi! I'm Alejandra González (*she / her*) a Rust programmer and tech enthusiast, you probably found me from [my contributions](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+author%3Ablyxyas&type=pullrequests) to the Rust Proyect, I also have a [cool blog](https://goose.love/blog).

[You can check my "About me" page for cooler effects! (Please I wasted a lot of time just building that cool thing)](https://goose.love)
