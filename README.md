Hi! I'm Alejandra González (*she / her*) a Rust programmer and tech enthusiast, you probably found me from [my contributions](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arust-lang+author%3Ablyxyas&type=pullrequests) to the Rust Proyect, I also have a [cool blog](https://blyxyas.github.io/blog).

I speak Spanish, English and Galician, so you can contact me in any of those three languages (without preference for any of them).

You can contact me at <blyxyas@gmail.com>
