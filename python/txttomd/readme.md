# README ⚠️ ↓

Hi! This program helps you to write faster and better markdown files, and its written in Python, very simple.
Btw this actually writes in HTML syntax, but you can customize that for your needs.

# Guide:

If you writes a keyword (e.g t1) then it will be translated to output.md in markdown format.
To break the format, just write a semi colon and the keyword, (e.g `t1` Title `;t` Text)

## Keywords

`t1`: Title <br>
`t2`: Title 2<br>
`t3`: Title 3<br>
`t4`: Title 4<br>
`t5`: Title 5<br>
`t6`: Title 6<br><br>
`cc`: Code<br>
`bb`: bold<br>
`ii`: italic<br>
`bcq`: blockquote<br><br>
`brk`: break<br>
`ul`: unordered list<br>
`ol`: ordered list


Im currently adding more keywords, so stay tuned, like tomorrow or something.
