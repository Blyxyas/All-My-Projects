# README ⚠️ ↓

Hi! This program helps you to write faster and better markdown files, and its written in Python, very simple.
Btw this actually writes in HTML syntax, but you can customize that for your needs.

# Guide:

If you writes a keyword (e.g t1) then it will be translated to output.md in markdown format.

## Keywords

t1: Title
t2: Title 2
t3: Title 3
t4: Title 4
t5: Title 5
t6: Title 6

4c: Code
6b: bold
8i: italic
6bb: blockquote

Im currently adding more keywords, so stay tuned, like tomorrow or something.
