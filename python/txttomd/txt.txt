t1 Hi ðŸ‘‹ ;t1
I'm bb Blyxyas ;bb And I'm just trying the cc beta ;cc version of my bbi NEW ;bbi text to markdown converter, so, it's very simple yet very bbi powerful and lightweight, ;bbi so it's very useful for weak devices!.

You can even have custom shortcuts and keywords for your text with this simple guidelines:

ol
. Write your shortcut / Custom syntax in the cc 'keywords' ;cc list
. Then write the html syntax for the same shortcut in the cc 'replacements' ;cc
. Then write the shortcut / custom syntax for the break in cc 'breakword' ;cc
. Then write the html syntax for the break in cc 'breakrepl' ;cc list
;ol

br If you want to write a global shortcut (for example a horizontal rule):
br br
ol
. Add the shortcut to the cc 'globalwords' ;cc list
. Then add the same shortcut, but in HTML syntax in the cc 'grepl' ;cc list.


;ol

Thanks for reading and bye!
